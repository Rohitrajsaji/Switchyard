# Local development

Run `make up` then `make smoke`. PostgreSQL binds only to localhost:54329 and the API to localhost:8080. PostgreSQL uses 17.11, the current PostgreSQL 17 minor release checked against the [official version policy](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) during setup. Go and distroless images are additionally pinned to manifest digests observed in the verified build. Runtime runs as non-root. No credentials, cached dependencies or generated binaries are tracked.

The Go module pins the installed toolchain (1.27.1) and pgx 5.11.0. `make` uses ignored project-local Go build/module caches. For direct `go` commands set `GOCACHE="$PWD/.cache/go-build"` and `GOMODCACHE="$PWD/.cache/go-mod"` where the filesystem restricts global caches.

Create the test database after starting PostgreSQL:

```sh
docker compose exec -T postgres createdb -U switchyard switchyard_test
```

If it already exists, use it without recreating it. Integration tests require a database name ending in `_test`, create a unique schema, set the pool's search path to it, and delete only that schema at cleanup. They never drop the development database.

`/health/live` checks process responsiveness; `/health/ready` checks PostgreSQL and the foundation migration. API starts even during a database outage and returns ready=503 until repaired. Readiness does not expose connection details. Request logs include method, route template, status, duration and a bounded request ID; no URLs, request bodies or database credentials.

Read-header/read/write/idle timeouts and body/header limits bound HTTP resource use. SIGTERM/SIGINT drains requests for up to ten seconds before force-close, then closes the pool. Compose normal shutdown preserves named volumes.

The dashboard, Redis, NATS, SDKs and telemetry containers arrive only at their approved milestones.

## M2 accounts and management API

Explicitly create local demo accounts after migrations:

```sh
SWITCHYARD_DEMO_PASSWORD='switchyard-demo-only' make seed
```

This local-only example creates `admin@example.test`, `reviewer@example.test`, `developer@example.test` and `viewer@example.test`. Re-running seed does not change existing credentials or duplicate creation audit entries. Login sends `POST /v1/session` with JSON email/password and `Origin: http://localhost:3000`, matching `SWITCHYARD_ORIGIN`. Keep the Set-Cookie cookie and returned `csrf_token`; mutations also send `X-CSRF-Token`. The current-session GET reissues that token after reload. No account is created unless seed is explicitly enabled.

Management endpoints and permission details are in [OpenAPI](../api/openapi.yaml). `make seed` does not automatically grant project memberships: the admin creates a project and grants others membership explicitly. Each project automatically gets development/staging/production. Production configuration is read-only until M9. Application credentials do not grant management access.

Cookie Secure is disabled only for local HTTP. A hosted deployment would need HTTPS, `COOKIE_SECURE=true`, an exact trusted origin, non-demo credentials and a separately approved deployment plan.
