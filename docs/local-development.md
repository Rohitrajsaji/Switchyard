# Local development

Run `make up` then `make smoke`. PostgreSQL binds only to localhost:54329 and the API to localhost:8080. PostgreSQL uses 17.11, the current PostgreSQL 17 minor release checked against the [official version policy](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) during setup. Go and distroless images are additionally pinned to manifest digests observed in the verified build. Runtime runs as non-root. No credentials, cached dependencies or generated binaries are tracked.

The Go module pins the installed toolchain (1.27.1) and pgx 5.11.0. `make` uses ignored project-local Go build/module caches. For direct `go` commands set `GOCACHE="$PWD/.cache/go-build"` and `GOMODCACHE="$PWD/.cache/go-mod"` where the filesystem restricts global caches.

Create the test database after starting PostgreSQL:

```sh
docker compose exec -T postgres createdb -U switchyard switchyard_test
```

If it already exists, use it without recreating it. Integration tests require a database name ending in `_test`, create a unique schema, set the pool's search path to it, and delete only that schema at cleanup. They never drop the development database.

`/health/live` checks process responsiveness; `/health/ready` checks PostgreSQL and the foundation migration. API starts even during a database outage and returns ready=503 until repaired. Readiness does not expose connection details. Request logs include method, route template, status, duration and a bounded request ID; no URLs, request bodies or database credentials.

Read-header/read/write/idle timeouts and body/header limits bound HTTP resource use. SIGTERM/SIGINT drains requests for up to ten seconds before force-close, then closes the pool. Compose normal shutdown preserves named volumes.

The dashboard, Redis, NATS, SDKs and telemetry containers arrive only at their approved milestones.
